### HTML Template (upload.html)
You also need a simple HTML form for file upload. Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory where your Python script resides, and inside that folder, create a file named `upload.html`:
```html<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head>    <meta charset="utf-8">    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">    <title>Online Assignment Submission</title></head><body>    <h1>Upload Assignment</h1>    <form action="{{ url_for('submit') }}" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">        <input type="file" name="file" required>        <input type="submit" value="Submit">    </form></body></html>```

### Running the Application
1. Save the Python code in a file named `app.py`.2. Make sure you have the `templates` directory with `upload.html` as described above.3. Run the application with the following command:
```bashpython app.py```
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the upload form.
### Note
- The application will handle `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, and `.txt` file types. You can modify `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` to include other file types as needed.- Uploaded files will be saved in the `uploads` directory.
